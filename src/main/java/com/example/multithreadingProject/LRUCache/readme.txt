If the synchronized keyword is used on both the put and get methods, then only one thread can execute either put or get at a time for the same instance of the LRUCache class. This behavior is due to how synchronized works:

How synchronized Works
Object-Level Lock:

When a thread enters a synchronized method (e.g., put or get), it acquires the monitor lock on the instance of the class (this).
Other threads trying to execute any synchronized method on the same instance are blocked until the current thread releases the lock.
Mutual Exclusion Across Synchronized Methods:

If one thread is executing put, no other thread can execute get (or put) simultaneously on the same instance because the synchronized methods are guarded by the same lock.
This ensures thread safety but also serializes access, which can lead to contention in high-concurrency scenarios.
Impact on Multiple Threads
One Thread at a Time:

If one thread is executing a put operation, all other threads will be blockedâ€”even if they only want to perform a read operation (get).
Reduced Parallelism:

Even though reads (get) don't modify the underlying structure and could, in theory, execute concurrently, they are serialized because of the shared lock on the instance.
Potential Optimization
If high concurrency with frequent reads is expected, and contention becomes an issue, you can consider the following optimizations:

Separate Lock for Reads and Writes:

Use ReentrantReadWriteLock to allow multiple threads to perform get operations concurrently, while still ensuring exclusive access for put.
java
Copy code
private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

public V get(K key) {
    lock.readLock().lock();
    try {
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            Node<K,V> node = cache.get(key);
            lock.readLock().unlock();  // Release read lock before acquiring write lock
            lock.writeLock().lock();  // Upgrade to write lock
            try {
                moveToHead(node);
            } finally {
                lock.writeLock().unlock();
            }
            return node.value;
        }
        return null;
    } finally {
        if (lock.getReadHoldCount() > 0) {  // Ensure the read lock is released
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}

public void put(K key, V value) {
    lock.writeLock().lock();
    try {
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            Node<K,V> node = cache.get(key);
            node.value = value;
            moveToHead(node);
        } else {
            Node<K,V> node = new Node<>(key, value);
            cache.put(key, node);
            addToHead(node);
            if (cache.size() > capacity) {
                Node<K,V> removedNode = removeTail();
                cache.remove(removedNode.key);
            }
        }
    } finally {
        lock.writeLock().unlock();
    }
}
Concurrent Collections and Atomic Operations:

Use a combination of ConcurrentHashMap and lock-free linked lists if further performance improvements are needed, but this adds complexity.
Summary
The synchronized implementation ensures:

Thread safety by serializing access to the cache.
Only one thread at a time can execute put or get.
If your application requires high concurrency, especially with frequent reads, you should consider adopting ReentrantReadWriteLock to allow concurrent reads and optimize performance while maintaining correctness for writes.
